  show errors when fail to transcribe
  add a graph function to the data
  

  deploy

Future
  choose from Magnus UI or Dripsy as UI framework
    https://dev.to/redbar0n/magnus-ui-vs-dripsy-chakra-ui-alternatives-for-react-native-web-4h28
  add an assets folder
  enable changing of table on client side
    should generate the appropriate fields
  incorporate auth0 to the user authentication

  I have been working on this app which enables anyone of any background
  to effortlessly create structured data

  I works by simply speaking into the app
  running 2 miles 10 minutes 33 seconds

  then you can save it into the database 

  for more information visit my other posts

  I recently updated the app to enable the user to create their own table
  (it works like this)
  
  the only thing missing is the incorporation of  natural language
  processing to make sense of the data

  if anyone would like to join the development of the app
  please feel free to getin contact with me













  The idea behind data logger is to be able to record data into
  a database by only speaking into your phone

  Data logger was developed with growth in mind so that when new categories
  of data are concieved they can quickly be added to data logger

  for example here I created a category for tracking my running
  based on my experience adding the running categry
  it takes about 30 minutes of programming to add the new category

  so i will simply speak into my phone

  this information is transcribed and parsed into fields
  which can then be edited and discarded or submitted to the database


  This is data logger
  an application im working on that transcribes voice data
  structured data to use in a database
  for example
  running 1.2 miles 2 minutes 32 seconds and as a result
  awsome now were just gonna edit the data because im a liar
  it only takes me 1 second to run that 
  and then save it to the data
  now its saved to the database
  running is only one category there is also testing
